# **Instructions**

Open script location in terminal, run the script, and choose a mode.
Quick is recommended if you just want a window with some text.
Advanced is for if you have a specific project in mind and want to pre-set configurations.
! Generated files will be placed in the same place as the script !



Also, Use this at your own discretion. 
Always be wary of random online scripts! especially since cel7 is written in FE.
